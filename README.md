# 🌄 Canyon Radar 🧗‍♂️

![In Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in--development-orange)

Canyon Radar is a web app to help you plan **canyoning trips** based on a chosen location. You can use your **current location** 📍 or pick a point on a map 🗺️. The app finds all canyons reachable within a specified **driving time** ⏱️ and lets you **export the results** 📊 to CSV or Excel for planning.

## 🚀 Live Demo

Try it here: [Canyon Radar](https://canyon-radar.elouanboiteux.fr) 🌐

## ✨ Features

-   **Find nearby canyons** 🏞️
    Enter a location (current location or map point) and a maximum driving time. The app shows all canyons reachable within that time.

-   **Export data** 📄
    Export the filtered canyon data, including coordinates and canyon info, to CSV or Excel for planning or analysis.

---

## ⚙️ How it works

-   Uses the [OpenRouteService Directions API](https://openrouteservice.org/) 🚗 to calculate driving times between points.
-   A **Node.js backend** hosted on **Vercel** 🟣 handles API requests securely, keeping the API key hidden from the client.
-   Frontend built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** 💻.
-   Canyon data stored in `data.json` 🗂️, processed to filter locations based on driving time.
